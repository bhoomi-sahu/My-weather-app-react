# 🌦 Weather App (React.js) — Live Project

**🔗 Live Demo:** [Click here to view the app](https://bhoomi-sahu.github.io/My-weather-app-react/)

It's my first project using React.js!  
I learned a lot from building this weather app. It helped me understand how to:
- Integrate third-party APIs (OpenWeatherMap)
- Manage state using React Hooks
- Build clean, responsive UIs

Working on this project improved my confidence in React and frontend development. Looking forward to building more real-world apps like this!

##  Dev Info

This app was bootstrapped using **Vite + React**:

- [`@vitejs/plugin-react`](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) — uses **Babel** for fast refresh
- [`@vitejs/plugin-react-swc`](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) — uses **SWC** for even faster refresh
