# It's my first project using react.js!
I learned a lot from building this project. It helped me understand how to integrate third-party APIs, manage state using React hooks, and design responsive UIs. Working on this weather app improved my confidence in React and frontend development overall. Looking forward to building more real-world projects like this!
